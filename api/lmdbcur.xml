  Manager for an LMDB database-traversal cursor.


  <!-- Ctr/dtr -->

  <constructor name = "new overall">
    Creates a cursor that traverses all k/y pairs in the DB in ascending order.
    Returns NULL on any error.

    <argument name = "dbi" type = "lmdbdbi" />
    <argument name = "txn" type = "lmdbtxn" />
  </constructor>

  <constructor name = "new fromkey">
    Creates a cursor that traverses all k/y pairs in the DB in ascending order,
    starting at the provided key. This key must exist.
    Returns NULL on any error.

    <argument name = "dbi" type = "lmdbdbi" />
    <argument name = "txn" type = "lmdbtxn" />

    <argument name = "key" type = "anything" mutable = "0" />
    <argument name = "key size" type = "size" />
  </constructor>

  <destructor>
  </destructor>


  <!-- Moving the cursor -->

  <method name = "next">
    Move the cursor to the next k/v pair in the db, in key sorted
    ascending order.
    Returns 0 on success, or -1 if no such key exists.
    <return type = "integer" />
  </method>


  <!-- Accessing the k/v the cursor is pointing to -->

  <method name = "key">
    Returns the key the cursor is curently pointing to.
    You need this when you call _next() and don't know what's there.
    Returns nullish lmdbspan on error (!lmdspan_valid (s)), which isn't a real
    value that can be returned from the DB.
    <return type = "lmdbspan" c_type = "lmdbspan" />
  </method>

  <method name = "val">
    Like key(), but returns the value the cursor is curently pointing to.
    <return type = "lmdbspan" c_type = "lmdbspan" />
  </method>
  

  <!-- Accessors -->

  <method name = "handle">
    Return a pointer to the underlying MDB_cur we're managing.
    BEWARE: this is an escape hatch for people that *really* need it; if you
    need more functionality then prefer to extend this library to contain it.
    <return type = "MDB_cursor ptr" c_type = "MDB_cursor *" />
  </method>

</class>
