  <!-- Accessors -->

  <method name = "handle">
    Return a pointer to the underlying MDB_env instance.
    BEWARE: this is an escape hatch for people that *really* need it; if you
    need more functionality then prefer to extend this library to contain it.
    <return type = "MDB_env pointer" c_type = "MDB_env *" />
  </method>
